Menon founded Sobha limited (formerly Sobha Developers Ltd) in 1995 with a clear vision to transform the way people perceive quality. Today, Sobha, a Rs. 25 billion company, is one of the largest and only backward integrated real estate players in the country.
			Since inception, the Company has always strived for benchmark quality, customer centric approach, robust engineering, in-house research, uncompromising business ethics, timeless values and transparency in all spheres of business conduct, which have contributed in making it a preferred real estate brand in India. In 2006, Sobha went public through its initial public offering, an event that created history when the issue got oversubscribed a record 126 times. Headquartered in Bangalore, Sobha is primarily focused on residential and contractual projects. The Company’s residential projects include Apartments villas, row houses, luxury and super luxury apartments, plotted development and aspirational homes replete with world-class amenities. In all its residential projects, the company lays a strong emphasis on environmental management, water harvesting and high safety standards. On the contracts side, the Company has constructed a wide variety of structures for corporates including corporate offices, convention centres, software development blocks, multiplex theatres, hostel facilities, guest houses, food courts, restaurants, research centres and club houses. Some of Sobha’s prestigious corporate clients include Infosys, Taj Group, Dell, HP, Timken, Biocon, Institute of Public Enterprises (IPE), Bosch, Hotel Leela Ventures and others.
